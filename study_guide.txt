1. Reuse: Provide rationale on why we need to reuse requirements?
Answer: Reuse means taking advantage of work that's already been done earlier.
This helps us in improving the overall productivity, overall quality as well as greater consistency between the related systems.
There are 4 major reasons why we can reuse requirements:
 =1. Increase productivity:  Faster delivery, lower development costs, increased consistency both within and across systems and higher team productivity.
    Reusing trusted requirements can save review time ,accelerate the approval cycle and speed up other project activities such as testing.
 =2. Reuse can improve the ability to estimate implementation effort if data from implementing the same requirements on a previous project is available.
 =3. Increase quality: There will be fewer defects, reduced rework since reusable requirements have usually been well designed, implemented and tested.
 =4. From the user's perspective ,requirements reuse can improve functional consistency across related members of a product line or among a set of business applications.
